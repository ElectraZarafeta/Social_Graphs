    "\n",
    "The aim of this analysis is to investigate the interactions between congress members on twitter, which is a social media that politicians seem to love using to dicsuss, be presented and influence. We will be able to understand how the two parties, Republicans and Democrats, use twitter in order to promote their political work, insights regarding the political rally and investigate the main issues discussed during the elections. Do they focus on citizens' problems? How influential are they? Are they strong members of any community? How do they interbehave towards other congressmen, are they supporting their political allies, criticizing the other side or following their leader? We believe that it will be very interesting to analyze the above from a data scientist's prespective.\n",

In order to download the dataset we used the list of the congress people [1] and based on that we used the Twitter API to download all the required data, like Tweets, to continue with our analysis.\n",
